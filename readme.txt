Compilation Instructions

Assuming you have Python 3 installed on your machine,
running the game is simple.  Just open the Connect_4 folder 
in your terminal, and enter the command

"python3 game.py"

File descriptions:

board.py stores all of the information about the Board() 
object. This includes the evaluation function, the minimax 
algorithm, and the logic of the game such as checking for 
wins, placing pieces, etc.

The game.py just runs the game from the main() function and 
deals with handling input and the command line interface, 
and running the actual game.
